# MiniGame
### [Live Demo](https://adamnizol.github.io/miniGame/)

MiniGame is my implementation of the Dollar Game which is derived from work done in graph theory. I was inspired to make it when I watched a [video by numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U33dsEcKgeQ) which explained the concept and the math behind choosing an initial state to guarantee winning is possible.
